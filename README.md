# CSEC-620-Project-3

 Phishing attacks pose a significant threat in todayâ€™s digital
 world, exploiting vulnerabilities in user trust and systems to
 steal sensitive information. Our project will investigate the
 application of machine learning to classify URLs as phishing
 or legitimate, addressing the drawbacks of traditional methods
 like blacklists and heuristic based systems. Using a feature rich
 dataset with over 88,000 real world samples and 111 features,
 we will train various machine learning models. Random Forest,
 Logistic Regression, Transformer Models, and XGBoost, each
 chosen for their proven capabilities in phishing detection. Our
 findings show that XGBoost is one of the best performers,
 with Random Forest following closely, both excelling in their
 precision and recall. Transformer models, with their ability
 to analyze sequential data patterns, also perform well. The
 research will show the importance of scalable, adaptable
 solutions for phishing detection and explore the potential for
 real time deployment of these models.
